libkdtree provides a C99 implementation of kd-trees. Kd-trees are space-partitioning trees that facilitate fast nearest-neighbor and range searches. The present implementation contains two flavors of kd-trees. The first kind of tree is constructed in n-dimensional Euclidean space; the second kind of tree is constructed from data on the 2-d surface of a sphere.

Other features are:\begin{itemize}
\item Fast parallelized tree construction using POSIX threads\item Nearest neighbor search and\item N-nearest neighbor search\item Range search inside a (hyper-)sphere\item Range search inside a (hyper-)rectangle\item Sorted result lists are stored in an efficient min-max heap\item Storage of arbitrary data associated with each point \end{itemize}
